# CrackSystems
2D linear elasticity plane strain FEM codes for the computation of stresses in systems of en echelon and randomly distributed cracks

README

In this repository, you may find the codes to calculate stress tensor components in 2D section of a body with different crack systems undergoing linear elastic deformation.
The codes are written in the MATLAB environment, and they are based on the plane strain approximation.
The main files are those named
